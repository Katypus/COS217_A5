authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used

None.

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

Horrendous. Horrible. Horrendous. Actually the meanest thing anyone's ever
done to me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

This was the most headache-inducing, painful thing any course has done
to me in the entire two years I've been here. It was HORRIBLE. I had 
three essays and two psets aside from this and everything else felt like
taking a little break in comparison to this. A4 felt like a little 
vacation in comparison to this. General Chemistry felt like a breeze in
comparison to this. There are not enough words in the English language
to describe how much I hated this assignment. This was the absolute
worst thing anyone has ever done to me. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

We suspect that our part 2e has some sort of minor bug in how we store
and restore our register values, which is causing a seg fault.

What is your mywc program test plan?

Boundary tests:
mywc000.txt: empty text file, tests if the program works at a 
minimum boundary
mwc001.txt: text file containing only new lines, tests if the program 
works for a file with only one type of value in it
mwc002.txt: text file containing only spaces, tests if the program 
works for a file with only one type of value in it
mywc003.txt: text file containing only a single word, tests if the 
program works for the minimum of one word
mywc004.txt: text file containing a word, two new lines in a row, and then
another word, tests if the program works for the case of two consecutive 
new lines (here, we are focusing on the word count)
mywc005.txt: text file containing a word, two spaces, and then another 
word, tests if the program works for two consecutive spaces (here, 
we are focusing on the word count)
mywc006.txt: text file containing a word, a space, a new line, a space, 
and then another word, tests if the program works for a more complex 
variation of spaces and new lines
Stress tests:
mywc007.txt: randomly generated ASCII characters, 40099 characters
mywc008.txt: randomly generated ASCII characters, 45099 characters
Statement tests:
mywc009.txt: first character in the file is a space, which makes it go to 
if1. iInWord is FALSE, so nothing else changes. The next few characters 
are letters. They go into the else1. Here, the not iInWord is TRUE for the
first character, which makes iInWord change to TRUE. Nothing changes for 
the next few characters. The next character is a space, which goes into 
the if1, iInWord is now TRUE, which causes the lWordCount to increment, 
and iInWord to change to FALSE. The next character is a new line, which 
goes into if2, and increases lLineCount. Then we have another word, and
this word is followed by EOF. The first character of the word changes 
the iInWord back to TRUE. Because of EOF, we exit the loop. Because 
iInWord is TRUE, lWordCount increments.
